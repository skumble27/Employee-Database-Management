# sql-challenge - Pewlett Hackard 

**Background**

At the behest of the Senior Manager of Pewlett Hackard, Data Analytics were undertaken based on employee records from the 1980's to the end of the 1990's. Based on the six CSV files that were provided, a consolidated Database was developed and engineered in order to subsequently undertake the relevant queries and analyses as required by the Senior Management. In order to achieve this, an Entity Relationship Diagram was developed as a framework in which to reconcile the disparate data sets. An outline has been provided below:

As seen in the above diagram, the relevant primary and foreign keys were assigned to the relevant tables in order to facilitate the Data Analytics Process.
